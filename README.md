## Introduction to React Composition Pattern

The React Composition Pattern is an approach to creating flexible and reusable user interfaces in React. Leveraging React's unique ability to create and combine independent components, this pattern enables the construction of complex interfaces by composing simpler elements.

By adopting the React Composition Pattern, developers can take advantage of the modularity and reusability intrinsic to React's component system. Instead of relying on deep hierarchies and component inheritance, the composition pattern emphasizes building small, specialized components, each focused on a specific task.
